# TwitterDemo
Demo app for Twitter

This is a Twitter client demo, capable of showing user timeline, a list of followers, post a tweet, and add location to the tweet. More features coming soon.

Is using Core Location Framework, the Objective-C Twitter API and is written in Swift 3.

The app used oAuth, at this moment not allow user login because the current keys and tokens provided by Twitter does not allow xAuth, the keys and tokens are attached to a dummy Twitter account.

##Warning:
I encourage you to use your own keys and tokens changing the file TwitterAPIKeys.plist within the project, is up to you if you use a personal account or a dummy one, the keys and tokens are provided by Twitter and you can create them by following [this link](https://dev.twitter.com/)
